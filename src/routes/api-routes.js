/*
 * PLAIN ENGLISH: This is the address the booking page calls to ask which
 *   ticket classes exist, or which ones are offered on a certain day.
 * LOGIC: One address handles both questions. If the request includes a day
 *   (?day=tuesday), it is passed to getTicketClassesForDay. If there is no
 *   day, it is passed to getAllTicketClasses.
 * WHY WE NEED IT: The assignment asks for /api/ticket-classes and
 *   /api/ticket-classes?day={day}. The part after the question mark is not
 *   part of the address, so both arrive at this same route.
 * LEARNING GAP: This file only writes '/ticket-classes'. The '/api' in front
 *   is added by src/routes/router.js. The data itself comes from the
 *   controller, which gets it from the model and the ticketClasses
 *   collection.
